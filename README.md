# class
> Allow create scalable, reusable high-quality and strong typed JavaScript classes, applications and libraries with one main statement `Klass.Class` or simply `Klass`. 
`Klass.Class` gives the possibility to create a class avoiding create explicitely getters, setters and properties (using `Object.defineProperty` or `Object.defineProperties`) but only by listing the properties.

## Syntax

Two main syntaxes are possible: 

  - Object for description of properties
  
  
  
  - String short syntax for the definition of properties
